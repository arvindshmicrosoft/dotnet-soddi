It's fine when you state that you are a full time developer with the name of the app (which I left as it establishes credibility, like you said), but when it goes on to discuss the benefits of the app and it's free and how to get it with links to download etc, that is beyond what is necessary and appropriate in this context. I should also note that watching someone go straight to the name-calling in comments and flags over a routine good-faith edit is generally a big red flag for us to pass on appointing them as a moderator."
